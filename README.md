## Timeline

* Pre-trained backbone models and fine-tuned downstream detection models are now available and can be downloaded [here](https://connecthkuhk-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/rjchen_connect_hku_hk/El41ikxgHGFKr3E61JGz7JgBjITYBpO4u2WiVqYu_PxBpg?e=pItkKZ)
* As there exists other downstream datasets, we will release results on other datasets once we finish the experiments.
* We will release pre-training code based on MMDetection3D (https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection3d) once the paper is accepted.
